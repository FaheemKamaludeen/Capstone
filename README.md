# Clustering-Indian-Restaurants-in-Toronto
I have taken a scenario where a businessman wants to start a Indian restaurant in Toronto City. The business would like to find the best area to start this new restaurant such that it has the least competition from other Indian Restaurants in the neighborhood. 
I design a project to help achieve this by finding places that are viable and places with have the most competition in the City of Toronto for Indian Restaurants.

## Business Problem
The goal is to find options of the best neighbourhoods for a businessman to start a Indian Restaurant with least competition.
This project should be able to answer the question which nieghbourhoods are good options for them to start their business.
